# PCSO-Lottery-Case-Study
In this case study, I used the lotto results gathered from the [Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office](https://www.pcso.gov.ph/) website to determine the following:

- Learn what's the highest and lowest amount won by a player.
- Determine the highest number of winning players. 
- Determine if the PCSO Lottery is fair.
- Know when is the best day to play and which game to join.
- List the 12 best numbers to play in the game.
